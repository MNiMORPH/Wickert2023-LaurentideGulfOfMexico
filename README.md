## Contents

### MD02-2550-marine

* This folder, minus the Excel files, is the full input and output from running Bacon on core MD02-2550.
* Excel files for easier viewing of inputs and outputs:
  * `MD02-2550-marine.xlsx`: **Input.** Uncalibrated radiocarbon ages and sample depths; file contents are the same as `MD02-2550-marine.csv`.
  * `MD02-2550-marine_ageModel_Bacon.xlsx`: **Output.**  Calibrated age and depth information for core MD02-2550; file contents are nearly the same as `MD02-2550-marine_178_ages.txt`, but contain a second row with units.

The age model extends from ~0.5 to ~23.5 cal ka.
